# Reference

For the most up to date list of UDFs, look at API documentation for @scaladoc[`ColumnFunctions`][ColumnFunctions]. These UDFs are also registered with the SQL engine under the same name but with a `rf_` prefix (e.g. `dataCells` becomes `rf_dataCells`). 

@@@ note

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/s22s/raster-frames/issues) if there's a particular function you think should be included.
